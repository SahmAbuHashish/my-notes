## Introduction

I am Sahm abu hashish, I graduated from the University of Jordan in 2018 as an architect and worked for two years as a site engineer and supervisor for several construction companies. I'm looking now to change my career to be a web developer and my first step in this path is to take this Bootcamp.

# The fundamental laws of software developer mindset

### 1. Conceiving The Purpose of Software

Without purpose for a developer will end up with bad and complex programs

### 2. The Goals of Software Design

The design should be easy for the developer and helpful for others.

### 3. (Mis)understanding

Best ways to improve your design skills is to be sure that you fully understand the systems and tools you are working with.

### 4. Simplicity

Creates things that are easy to understand so that it’s easy to shake out all the bugs.

### 5. Complexity

Your main purpose is to control complexity, not to create it.
by Take things one step at a time.

### 6. Maintenance

There will always be some implementation of changes. Not only you have to implement them, but you also have to maintain them over time. As a developer, thinking about future maintenance of changes is one of your main responsibilities

### 7. Consistency

If you do something one way in one place, do it that way in every place in youer code .

### 8. Prioritizing

best decisions about your software is The desirability of any change is directly proportional to the value of the change and inversely proportional to the effort involved in making the change.

### 9. Solving Problems

The first step is understanding the problem The second step is planning, Think before acting.The third step is dividing

### 10. Good enough is fine

Start small, improve it, then extend.

### 11. Predictions

Being too generic involves a lot of code that isn’t needed.
Don’t predict to future. Be only as generic as you know you need to be right now.

### 12. Assumptions

Code should be designed based on what you know now, not on what you think will happen in the future

### 13. Stop Reinventing

Don’t reinvent the wheel unless:

You need something that doesn’t exist yet
All of the existing “wheels” are bad technologies or incapable of handling your needs
The existing “wheels” aren’t being properly maintained

### 14. Resistance

Always resist adding more code, more features until you are convinced that they are required and there is a need to implement them. Because unnecessary changes will increase defects in your software.

### 15. Automation

Don’t spend your time on repetitive tasks try to automate them.

### 16. Code measurement

The optimum code is a small bunch of code that is easy to understand, easy to read.

#### 17. Productivity

### 18. Testing

When you have a bug, first you should reproduce it. You shouldn’t guess the source of the bug and apply fixes based on your assumption. Most probably, you will be wrong. You should see it with your own eyes before applying the fix.

### 19. (Under)Estimation

Break the big thing into smaller things. The smaller it is, the easier it is to estimate. You’re probably still going to get it wrong, but you’ll be a lot less wrong than if you estimated a big project.
Everything takes longer than you think.

### 20. Running Away From Rewriting

Refactoring should be the first option.

### 21. Documentation and Commenting

- When you can’t make the code simpler then you should add the comment to explain this complexity.
- Another thing is documenting. It is important to have documentation to explain your software’s architecture and every module and components. This is required to see the high-level picture of your software.

### 22. Picking Technologies

There are a few factors you should consider before you start using some technology:

- Is there active development behind it?
- Will it continue to be maintained?
- How easy is it to switch away from?
- What does the community say about it?

### 23. Self-Development

Keep learning. Try out different programming languages and tools, read books on software development. They will give you another perspective. Every day small improvements will make a real difference in your knowledge and skills.

### 24. Don’t be a hero

Know when to quit. Don’t hesitate to ask for help.

### 25. Don’t Ask Questions… Ask For Help

When you can’t think of anything on your own, search! Find answers and try them out. Modify those answers, see if you can understand why they work, adapt them to your code. But always seek advice
